# tensorflow-cpp-begin
Trying out tutorils for tensorflow in cpp.

# Rough Work
1-D => float
F = x * y
gradX = dF / dx = y
gradY = dF / dy = x
[1/dy1 1/dy2 1/dy3] *	[d(xy1)]
			[d(xy2)]
			[d(xy3)]


[]  [] < [] ->
[]  []
[]

# TODO -
1) Separate out the code.
2) Initialization of the grad in Tensor.
3) BFS instead of DFS
